About Me
I am Lê Thanh Lâm, a Software Developer passionate about building innovative and user-friendly web solutions. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,PHP and C#, I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skill set. I focus on front-end development, but I have experience across full-stack development, particularly with C# and SQL Server databases.

Currently, I am looking for opportunities to apply my expertise in a professional setting, contribute to impactful projects, and grow in a collaborative environment. Whether working on responsive designs, dynamic applications, or database-driven projects, my goal is to create seamless user experiences and efficient systems.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work!
